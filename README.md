# 4chanCaptchaSolver

The model is taken from https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/4chan-captcha-solver and converted into tflite format.

# How to use
- Go to https://github.com/K1rakishou/4chanCaptchaSolver/releases and find the latest release.
- Download an APK for your CPU architecture. It's most likely "arm64-v8a" or "armeabi-v7a" if you have an old phone.
- Install it, make sure to restart KurobaEx (always restart the app when installing/updating/uninstalling solver apk since KurobaEx only checks it's status once).
- Upon next captcha load it should be solved automatically. You don't need to run the captcha solver app at all, everything is automated.
- If it says that there is a version mismatch then make sure KurobaEx and this app are both updated to the latest version.
